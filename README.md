# Excehl Geospatial

**Automated Workflows | Spatial Data Integrity | Intelligent Systems**

Excehl Geospatial is a development studio dedicated to modernizing geospatial tradecraft. We focus on **clean, reproducible workflows** that bridge the gap between traditional Earth Science and modern Data Engineering.

Led by **Jason Ehlenberger (GISP, IHO Cat B)**, the studio leverages over 20 years of experience in defense intelligence and hydrography to build systems that make spatial data more reliable, accessible, and actionable.

---

## 🔭 Mission & Focus
We are exploring how **Cloud-Native architectures** and **AI agents** can solve complex spatial problems. Our core pillars are:
* **Data Integrity:** Building "Single Source of Truth" systems using rigorous topology and validation logic.
* **Automation:** Replacing manual GIS tasks with Python, SQL, and API-driven ETL pipelines.
* **Integration:** Connecting disparate tools (Notion, ArcGIS, GitHub) into unified operational pictures.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Our projects explore the intersection of enterprise GIS and modern software engineering:

* **Geospatial Engineering:** Python (GeoPandas, Shapely, Rasterio, GDAL/OGR) and SQL (PostGIS, DuckDB).
* **Cloud-Native Geospatial:** Cloud-Optimized formats (COG, GeoParquet) and STAC catalogs.
* **Esri Ecosystem:** Advanced automation for ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, and Living Atlas.
* **DevOps & CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated testing, documentation, and reproducibility.
* **Emerging Tech:** Experimenting with Apache Sedona, generative AI agents, and semantic search for spatial data.

## 📂 Projects
Active work lives in dedicated repositories across the ExcehlGeo organization. This repository (`.github`) serves as the central entry point and documentation hub.

* **[Personal Data Warehouse](https://github.com/ExcehlGeo/excehl)**: A serverless system acting as a Single Source of Truth. Integrates Notion, GitHub, and external APIs to automate career data governance.
* **[Project Name]**: *Another key tool or automation script (Placeholder).*

## 🔄 Workflow Overview
We treat geospatial analysis as software development:
* **Version Control:** All development occurs in feature branches with strict review gates.
* **Reproducibility:** If it isn't scripted, it didn't happen. We use Make and Actions to ensure outputs can be recreated.
* **Documentation:** Knowledge is maintained in external systems (Notion/Docs) but linked here for context.

*For detailed conventions, see the `docs/` directory.*

# Excehl Geospatial

Excehl Geospatial is a studio dedicated to clean, reproducible workflows for mapping, spatial analysis, and decision support. This repository serves as the entry point for the ExcehlGeo organization—defining shared conventions, linking portfolio projects, and anchoring broader workflow integrations across development, documentation, and portfolio systems.

## Projects

Active and planned work lives in dedicated repositories across the `ExcehlGeo` organization:

- **Project 1 — TBD**
- **Project 2 — TBD**

As new repositories are created, list them here with a concise one‑sentence description.

## Tech Stack

Current and emerging tools explored in these projects include:

- **Python** for geospatial data engineering and analysis (GeoPandas, Shapely, Rasterio, GDAL/OGR, PyProj, xarray)
- **Cloud‑native geospatial** approaches, including cloud‑optimized formats (COG, GeoParquet), STAC catalogs, and object‑storage–based data pipelines
- **Scalable spatial analytics and GeoAI**, with experimentation in engines like DuckDB, Apache Sedona, and machine‑learning workflows applied to spatial datasets
- **Esri ecosystem** tools such as ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, and Living Atlas for publishing, visualization, and sharing work
- **Automation and integration** using GitHub Actions, Make, and related workflow tools to support reproducibility, data refreshes, and CI/CD
- **Emerging technologies** in geospatial data science, cloud compute, and AI‑assisted development, explored as they become relevant to modern workflows

## Workflow Overview

- Development occurs in feature branches.
- Pull requests into `main` require review and must pass automated checks.
- Higher‑level planning, documentation, and portfolio materials are maintained outside this repository (e.g., in external knowledge bases or portfolio systems).

Additional conventions and notes can be found in the `docs/` directory.
